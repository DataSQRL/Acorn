# Java Implementation of SmartRAG

This is the Java implementation of SmartRAG.

It is based on the [OpenAI Java library](https://github.com/TheoKanning/openai-java) by Theo Kanning.

You can find the example ChatBot implementations in the test directory:
`src/test/java/com/datasqrl/ai/examples`

This is a proof-of-concept implementation and the library has not yet been published to Maven Central.
We are working on it.

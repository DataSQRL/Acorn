# Acorn Agent Starter

This module contains [example command line chatbot implementations](src/test/java/com/datasqrl/ai) that demonstrate how to use Acorn Agent generically (i.e. without a framework) at different abstraction levels.

It also includes APIExecutor implementations for GraphQL and REST.

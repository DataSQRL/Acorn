# Public API Examples

This directory contains examples of using apiRAG with publicly accessible APIs. To run these examples, all you need is Docker and an API key for the Large-Language-Model provider of your choice. 

Running the examples takes less than a minute, and you can modify them however you'd like.

* [Rick and Morty](rickandmorty/): A chatbot that answers questions about the show by looking up the information from the public Rick and Morty GraphQL API.
* [I'm Bored](activity/): A chatbot that helps you find things to do by looking up activities from a public REST API by App Brewery.
* [Advice Monster](advice/): A chatbot that dispenses advice retrieved from a REST endpoint.

We want to highlight that the APIs used in the examples above are NOT our own and are operated by other people and organizations for the public to enjoy. We do not endorse those APIs. We merely want to show how easy it is to build intelligent ChatBots that can retrieve information from existing APIs for knowledge augmentation.
